SCIM Setup Utilities

---What's it---

A set of modules to handle SCIM settings, especially the settings about
SCIM setup in the booting flow. For example, to enable/disable SCIM by 
default or to get the default IM list for a particular language in the 
first boot.

---Installation---

Run "python setup.py install"

---How to use---

Please see the example "scim/examples/ssu_ex.py".

---Modules---

scim.ssu - the main module for reading/writing SCIM setup settings.

It provide two functions, get and set, to read/write settings. They always
return a list as their return value, even there is only one value returned. 
(i.e. a list contains only one entry.) If an error occurs, an exception is 
thrown. We suggest using this module in python codes.

scim.ssuget 
scim.ssuset - interface modules embedded in other languages.

Each of them provides one and only one function called run. The run function
always return a string as it's return value. If several values are returned,
they are merged in a string and separated with comma. If an error occurs, a
string ERR_XXXXXX is returned. We suggest using these modules in other 
programming language such as C/C++.

---Stos-ssu Tools---

stos-ssuget - a script tool to get the settings.
stos-ssuset - a script tool to set the settings.

They are tools which can be run in the cmdline environment. Please run they 
with --help option to see more detail usage. We suggest using them in shell
scripts.

---Available settings---

Please run stos-ssu tools with --list option to see the setting list.
