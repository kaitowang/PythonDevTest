STOS Import Manager

---What's it---

A set of modules to handle STOS settings which are imported from Window OS.

---Installation---

Run "python setup.py install"

---How to use---

Please see the example "stos/importmgr/examples/importmgr_ex.py".

---Modules---

stos.importmgr.core - the main module for reading/writing imported
                      settings.

It provides two functions, ucget and ucset, to read/write settings. They
always return a list as their return value, even there is only one value
returned(i.e. a list contains only one entry.). If an error occurs, an
exception is thrown. We suggest using this module in python codes.

stos.importmgr.ucget
stos.importmgr.ucset - interface modules embedded in other languages.

Each of them provides one and only one function called run. The run
function always returns a string as it's return value. If several values
are returned, they are merged in a string and separated with comma. If an
error occurs, a string ERR_XXXXXX is returned. We suggest using these
modules in other programming languages such as C/C++.

---stos-uc Tools---

stos-ucget - a script tool to get the settings.
stos-ucset - a script tool to set the settings.

They are tools which can be run in the cmdline environment. Please run them
with --help option to see more detail usage. We suggest using them in shell
scripts.

---Available settings---

Please run stos-uc tools with --setting-list option to see the setting
list.
